🎯 Aim-

To understand and explore various primitive data types in programming, with a focus on their usage in C++.

📚 Theory-

Primitive data types are the fundamental building blocks of any programming language. In C++, they are used to store and manipulate basic forms of data such as numbers, characters, and logical values.

Fundamental Data Types-

 int – Used to store integer values, like whole numbers.
 Example: int age = 30;

  float – Used for storing single-precision decimal numbers.
  Example: float temperature = 36.6f;

  double – Similar to float, but with double the precision (more accurate for decimals).
  Example: double pi = 3.14159;

  char – Stores a single character, like 'A' or '1'.
  Example: char grade = 'A';

  bool – Represents a boolean value: true or false.
  Example: bool isOnline = true;

  void – Represents "no type" and is mainly used for functions that do not return a value.
  Example: void printMessage();


 🛠️ Note: In C++, string is part of the Standard Library and requires:

    #include <string>
    using std::string;

🧠 Conclusion-

Mastering data types is essential for writing reliable, efficient, and expressive programs. Each type—whether it's an integer for counting, a float for precision, or a string for text—serves a unique purpose in representing and manipulating information.

By understanding how and when to use these types, you lay the groundwork for structured logic, memory management, and robust application development in C++. 🧱💻
