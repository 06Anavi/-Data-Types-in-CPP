Aim-
To understand and demonstrate the use of different basic data types in C++ programming.

Theory-
C++ provides various data types to store different kinds of information:

int stores whole numbers without decimal points.

float and double store decimal numbers, with double having higher precision.

char stores a single character.

bool stores truth values: true or false.

string stores a sequence of characters (text).

Using these data types effectively allows programmers to manage data efficiently according to its nature.

The program declares variables of each type and prints their values to demonstrate how each data type works.

Conclusion-
This program successfully demonstrated the declaration and usage of different fundamental data types in C++. By running the program, we observed how each data type stores and outputs its value. Understanding these basic data types is crucial for effective programming and data management in C++.
